            <p> As a daily commuter, and many others, people lack the time to
                make decisions. This may include the food they want to eat, the attire they want to don,
                what they want to do that evening, and so on. Our goal is that by designing an app to
                address these daily challenges, we are able to effectively accommodate people who
                lack decision making skills, busy people with no time on their hands to ponder small
                decisions, and people who simply want to spice up their life a little.

        <p>
            My group and I created an affinity diagram to brainstorm the logistics of our desired app. Creating this diagram has allowed us to create a makeshift map for us to adhere to upon the process of creating our app.
